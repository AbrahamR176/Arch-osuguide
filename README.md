# Arch-osuguide

A more or less detailed explanation of installing osu on arch.

**DISCLAIMER**

All the information that will be given here is based around my **OWN** experience. I am not responsible if anything breaks either in your linux installation or computer. 

Also this will be a guide for beginners. If you know your way around ThePoon's guide on installing osu!, then you probably do not need this guide.

## Installing-Linux

### Getting your system
First of all, if you want to run osu! on arch, you need to have arch running in your computer.

All the information regarding the installation of arch can be found in *https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide*, but since you are not expected to understand everything right away, I would stick to something easier to use, like an installer of some distribution based on arch.

Some of these distrubutions are:

    * RebornOS (https://rebornos.org/)
    * EndevourOS (https://endeavouros.com/)
    * Manjaro (https://manjaro.org/)
    * ArcoLinux (https://arcolinux.com/)
    * Archlabs (https://archlabslinux.com/)

The flavor you choose is entirely up to you, but I personally use RebornOS and I've found great sucess using it.

### Flashing your USB

Once you find the flavor of arch you want to test, you have to get it installed, and for that, I recommend flashing the **.iso** of your OS in a USB stick.

**In the process of putting the OS into your USB, all the data inside of it will be wiped, make sure you make a proper backup in case you have anything important on it.**

To get the OS into your USB stick, I recommend using the tool called Balena Etcher. It works in both Windows and MacOS, and its free. https://www.balena.io/etcher/. 

Open Balena Etcher, select the .iso of your arch distro, and then click on flash. it will take a while but eventually you will have your USB flashed and ready to use to install arch!.
