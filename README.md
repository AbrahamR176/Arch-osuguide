# Arch-osuguide

A more or less detailed explanation of installing osu on arch.

**DISCLAIMER**

All the information that will be given here is based around my **OWN** experience. I am not responsible if anything breaks either in your linux installation or computer. 

Also this will be a guide for beginners. If you know your way around ThePoon's guide on installing osu!, then you probably do not need this guide.

## Installing-Linux

### Getting your system
First of all, if you want to run linux on arch, you need to have arch running in your computer.

All the information regarding the installation of arch can be found in *https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Installation_guide*, but since you are not expected to understand everything right away, I would stick to something easier to use, like an installer of some distribution based on arch.

Some of these distrubutions are:

    * RebornOS (https://rebornos.org/)
    * EndevourOS (https://endeavouros.com/)
    * Manjaro (https://manjaro.org/)
    * ArcoLinux (https://arcolinux.com/)
    * Archlabs (https://archlabslinux.com/)

The flavor you choose is entirely up to you, but I personally use RebornOS and I've found great sucess using it.
