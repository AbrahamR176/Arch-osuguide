# Arch-osuguide

A more or less detailed explanation of installing osu on arch.

**DISCLAIMER**

All the information that will be given here is based around my **OWN** experience. I am not responsible if anything breaks either in your linux installation or computer. 

Also this will be a guide for beginners. If you know your way around ThePoon's guide on installing osu!, then you probably do not need this guide.
